## Interesting Points

- I like the fact that this article, unlike other articles, doesn't solely focus on suggesting good software development practices. Instead, the author provides advice on improving the daily activities of life which has immense indirect impact on a developer and helps in succeed in his professional career. 

- I agree to all of the points mentioned in the article to improve a developer's daily life. Consistency is the key for everything, not just in coding and software development world. I also like the point that it's important to do things aside from coding because that helps freshen up the mind and in turn improves problem solving skills, which is very much essential and necessary in coding. I especially love the statement "Code something new every day, and youâ€™ll become much better at software development!" This, I feel, is especially true in today's world as people get bored very quickly and easily. So, to keep up the motivation, learning and doing new things is important.
